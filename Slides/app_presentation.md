Overview
========================================================

This project aims to build a product which can predict the next word as the user starts typing words. In this capstone we will be applying data science in the area of natural language processing. This project includes Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and the associated tools in R. The prediction is based on the words present in the database on which the model is trained. Maximum Likelihood estimator with Kneyser Ney Smoothing has been used as the prediction model. This is a very simple version of Kneyser Ney smoothing based on certain assumptions made on the discount value.
