# Text-Prediction-NLP

# Overview

This project aims to build a product which can predict the next word as we start typing the words.
In this capstone we will be applying data science in the area of natural language processing. This project includes Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and the associated tools in R. Here are some resources

# Dataset

This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the Coursera site and not from external websites to start.

## Current State of the Project

I have conducted the exploratory analysis for this project. Here is [the link](https://rpubs.com/amanbhagat77/ExpAnalysis) to the analysis report.     

Currently working on a model which can predict the next word.
